First make a variable with the name of directory
	OBJ_DIR = obj_dir

Then make a variable OBJ_FILES, where you substitute .c with .o, but you attach the 
name of that directory to each .o
   Like so:		OBJ_FILES	= $(patsubst %, $(OBJ_DIR)/%, $(C_FILES_MAIN:.c=.o))
					OR
				OBJ_FILES	= $(addprefix $(OBJ_DIR)/, $(SRCS:.c=.o))
			
	
In some rule you need to write a recipe to create that directory:
 makedir:
	mkdir -p $(OBJ_DIR)


If you have other files in subfolders, you need to also make these paths:
 makedir:
	mkdir -p $(OBJ_DIR)
	mkdir -p $(OBJ_DIR)/subfolder


You need to call this rule somewhere at the begining:
 all: makedir $(NAME)


Then you include the obj_dir path in the .o rule:
 $(OBJ_DIR)/%.o:  %.c
	gcc -p $(FLAGS) -c $< -o $@
